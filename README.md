“Remember to avoid the RedZone”

### `The Idea`

When life gets complicated, sometimes when overspend our budget without realizing. Days later we find out that we are out of money for groceries. The Horror. This app allows users to create a budget and find out if they are in the danger zone. Well, we like to call it the RedZone

Users will create an account and set up thier budget amount. They can then add expenses to their account and if they enter the danger zone, they will be notified. Remember to avoid the RedZone. This app will help users see exactly where they are on their budget and figure out how much they are spending on an item.
